## Description 

We must create a “realistic” 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze from a first-person perspective.

We have to create this representation using the ray-casting principles.

## Instructions
The program displays the image in a window and respects the following rules:
1. The left and right arrow keys of the keyboard must allow you to look left and
right in the maze.
2. The W, A, S, and D keys must allow you to move the point of view through
the maze.
3. Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
4. Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and
quit the program cleanly.

## Resources
Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map.
